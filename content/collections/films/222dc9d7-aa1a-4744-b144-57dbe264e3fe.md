overview: "Veronika and Boris come together in Moscow shortly before World War II. Walking along the river, they watch cranes fly overhead, and promise to rendezvous before Boris leaves to fight.

After her house is bombed, Veronika moves in with Boris' family, into the company of a cousin with his own intentions."
